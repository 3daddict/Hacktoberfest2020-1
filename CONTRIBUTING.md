# Guidelines for adding files.

1. Every file should first **state the purpose of the program at the Top** (before the code). For example : *If you're creating a program to print the prime numbers in a range, then you should mention that at the beginning of the file by commenting it out*.

2. Don't add too basic programs like *addition of two numbers* or *hello world*.

3. Follow the above set pattern while making PRs otherwise it won't be merged.
